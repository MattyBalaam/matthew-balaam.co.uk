# Matthew Balaam 

I’m a frontend developer by day and this is my site. If you are interested in hiring me please <Link to={href("/cv")} viewTransition>view my CV</Link>

I also do a bit of DJing in my spare time and you can give that a listen <Link to={href("/music")} viewTransition>via the links on this page</Link>

This site will use a bit of a mix of approaches and is partly to help me explore approaches to building. e.g. this homepage is using `.mdx` files to allow easy editing of content, but other pages might use values returned from a database or json file. 

This site is currently under construction, so please excuse the shabby appearance :D
