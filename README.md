**You might notice this site is very old - maybe almost 10 years - I would build this site very differently today**

A simple React app example – I agree it is possibly overblown to use React for such a simple site, but I like JSX templating and also using this CV as this as a place to explore new libraries, approaches or build tools.

I’m currently using Vite to explore ESM dev builds.

The CV is built using a schema from https://jsonresume.org/
